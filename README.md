### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm just getting started with frontend development, so I'm still learning about all the possibilities. But I plan to fully master CSS and JavaScript, and I hope that Frontend Mentor will help me achieve that.
